# 220CTCoursework
This repository contains my work for the "Data and Information Retrieval" module in my 2nd year at Coventry University 
studying Bsc Computer Science. The tasks revolve around working with databases and Big Data. 
It contains questions regarding the use of SQL, the implementation of a database solution for a certain problem, the creation of a research
poster on how Big Data helps fight fraud and a bigger and more creative task revolving around acquiring data and exploring it, 
with visualisation and coming up with ideas on how to productively use it.

Task 1: SQL Normalisation and implementation of a database
Task 1 Part 2: A Database solution for holding information about exoplanets

Task 2: Poster regarding the use of Big Data in fighting fraud

Task 3: Data Mining on diabetes dataset, with a model to classify futher instances in the correct class

Task 4: An exploration of a used cars dataset, with data preprocessing and normalisation, data visualisation and an attempt to create a regression
        model to estimate the price of a car based on succesful sales.
        
I confirm this is all my work.
